## 1. Description

<br />

The **Bank Account Project** is a management system designed to simulate and manage financial transactions related to bank accounts. It offers features such as account registration, consultation, updating, and deletion, as well as transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

The system organizes customer information‚Äîincluding account holder name, account number, balance, and account type‚Äîensuring secure transactions. Its main objective is to automate and simplify the management of bank accounts, such as checking accounts and savings accounts, promoting agility and accuracy in financial control.

This project, developed in **Java**, focuses on the study and application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, including:

- Classes and Objects;
- Attributes and Methods;
- Access Modifiers;
- Inheritance and Polymorphism;
- Abstract Classes;
- Interfaces.

In addition to serving as a functional simulator, the project offers a practical basis for understanding the fundamental principles of OOP applied to a realistic scenario.

<br />

## 2. Project Functionalities

<br />

1. **Create a New Account:** Creates a new bank account by specifying the branch number, specific properties based on the account type, account holder's name, and initial balance. The account number is automatically generated;

2. **List All Accounts:** Lists all accounts registered in the system;

3. **Search Account by Number:** Finds an account using its account number;

4. **Search Account by Holder:** Finds one or more accounts associated with the account holder's name;

5. **Update Account Data:** Allows for updating the details of an existing account based on the account number;

6. **Delete Account:** Removes a specific account based on the account number;

7. **Withdraw:** Performs a withdrawal of an amount from an account, provided the balance is sufficient;

8. **Deposit:** Adds an amount to the balance of an existing account;

9. **Transfer:** Transfers an amount from one account to another, respecting the respective balances and limits.

## 3. Class Diagram

<br />

A **Class Diagram** is a visual model used in object-oriented programming to represent the structure of a system. It displays classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between them, such as associations, inheritance, and dependencies.

This diagram helps in planning and understanding the system's architecture, showing how the components interact and connect. It is widely used during the design and documentation phases of projects.

Below, you can see the Class Diagram for the Banking Account Project:

The project will be structured with the following **Classes** and **Interfaces**, each with clearly defined responsibilities:

| Class/Interface     | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **BankAccountApp**  | The application's main class. It contains the `main` method and is responsible for displaying the initial menu with all system functionalities. |
| **Colors**           | A utility class used to apply colors to the menu, improving the visual experience in the terminal. |
| **Account**           | The base class that defines the generic structure of a bank account. |
| **CheckingAccount**   | A class that extends `Account` and represents a checking account, with its specific features. |
| **SavingsAccount**   | A class that extends `Account` and represents a savings account, with its own functionalities. |
| **AccountRepository** | An interface that declares the methods to be implemented and used within the application's menu. |
| **AccountController** | A class that implements the `AccountRepository` interface, being responsible for the account manipulation logic. |
